# flutter_nordjs

A basic application for taking everyday notes.

In this application we are going to use nordjs, express and mongodb to structure our api.
On the flutter side we will use http to connect to our api.

We have uploaded all components for this application, the folder called http_nordjs is our flutter mobile application
and the folder called express_api_mongodb is our api that will connect to cloud database(atlas mongodb).
